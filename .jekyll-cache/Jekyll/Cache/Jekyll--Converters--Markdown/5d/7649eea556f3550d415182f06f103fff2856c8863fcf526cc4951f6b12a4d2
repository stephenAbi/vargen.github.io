<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>CI Fuzz is a software system including a fuzzing backend as well as a user interface.</p>

<p>Its fuzzing backend relies on docker to encapsulate different tasks such as building, running, and monitoring components. The user can interact with the system through a command line interface (CLI) or via the CI Fuzz extension for Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p><strong>CI Fuzz contains three main components:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>CI-Daemon: The CI-Server is responsible for backend tasks such as project compilation, managing fuzz-targets and operating the docker infrastructure and interacts with the CI-Client and the UI.</li>
  <li>User-Interface: The CI Fuzz extension for Visual Studio Code helps the user to create and manage fuzz-targets and reproduce crash.</li>
  <li>CI-Client: The CI-Client is the command line interface to initialize, build, and run fuzzers.</li>
</ul>
